## ICE 79
ice 79 is an Android cell phone offline tracker that uses only the SMS and GPS to
locate the phone.

application the necessary permissions to work properly. It is also recommended to
disable battery optimization to prevent the Android from putting the application
to sleep.

## Usage

query your location without asking. 
To query your phone's location, send an SMS message with the exact text
"ice-79/$get location" to your phone with one of the trusted numbers. The
application will reply to the number and send the location after a while.
